C++ Finite State Machine library

# Features
It currently features:
* Entry/Exit
* Transitions
* Check on transitions
* Event dispatch

It relies a lot (if not only) on C++11 templates and type traits.
It does not relies on any outside libraries and does not require particular
libraries.

# Work in progress
Master branch in considered stable, dev branch is currently work in
progress and you should expect every commit on dev to work properly.
